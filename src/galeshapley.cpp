//'
//' @param proposerPref is a matrix with the preference order of the proposing
//'   side of the market. If there are \code{n} proposers and \code{m} reviewers
//'   in the market, then this matrix will be of dimension \code{m} by \code{n}.
//'   The \code{i,j}th element refers to \code{j}'s \code{i}th most favorite
//'   partner. Preference orders must be complete and specified using C++
//'   indexing (starting at 0).
//' @param reviewerUtils is a matrix with cardinal utilities of the courted side
//'   of the market. If there are \code{n} proposers and \code{m} reviewers, then
//'   this matrix will be of dimension \code{n} by \code{m}. The \code{i,j}th
//'   element refers to the payoff that individual \code{j} receives from being
//'   matched to individual \code{i}.
//' @return  A list with elements that specify who is matched to whom. Suppose
//'   there are \code{n} proposers and \code{m} reviewers. The list contains

//'    matched to using C++ indexing. Proposers that remain unmatched will be
//'    listed as being matched to \code{m}.}

//'    element contains the number of the proposer that reviewer \code{j} is
//'    matched to using C++ indexing. Reviewers that remain unmatched will be
